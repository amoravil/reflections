What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a empty repository. 
	I need run git init 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It is a temporary area where you have the files you are sure you want to commit.It keeps files with complete work.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    I can add to the staging area all files that are involved in a logical change before to make a commit and without the problem to forget which are in working process and which ones are ready to commit.
